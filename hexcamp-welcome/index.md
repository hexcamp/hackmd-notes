# Welcome to Hex.Camp

The Hex.Camp open source project is building software tools and web hosting infrastructure for individuals and groups to enrich their local communities.

The core idea is a unique system for geographically organizing web sites, where each site is one of trillions of hexagons arranged on the world map. Combined with traditional and cutting edge web tools, communities can build online places to communicate, collaborate and archive. A non-profit governance model means that each community can be independent and self-reliant.

# What is it?

* Hexagons!
    * allow everybody to share information by placing things on a map
    * uses Uber's [H3](https://h3geo.org/) system for subdividing the world into hexagons
    * any hexagon can contain a website or data
    * hexagons can be "owned" by individual users or communities of users
    * core services are familiar web building blocks:
        * DNS
        * SSL
        * HTTP
    * super cheap to run
    * communities can run their own subsets of the global network

# Tools

* [Encoded Hexagon ID Lookup Tool](https://6l22glmvqj2a.test.hex.camp/) - use this tool to figure out where an "encoded hexagon ID" is on the map (eg. the ID for 6kgvdnw3nwza.seahex.org is "6kgvdnw3nwza")
* Node.js command line tool: [hexcamp-tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexcamp-tool) - contains useful subcommands for converting hexagon IDs


# Funding

Hex.Camp is entirely self-funded at the moment. [Jim Pick](https://jimpick.com/), the primary developer, works on it when he has time between freelance consulting projects. Feel free to inquire about availability or collaboration opportunities.

If you can help us find some grants or other funding, we can spend more time on pushing the project forward. Fundraising is a new thing for us, so any help is appreciated!

We have set up a [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/hexcamp) for small donations.

# Contact Info

Please reach out to our [small team](https://whimsicalmachines.com/) with your ideas or feedback! The primary developer, Jim is always at [@jimpick](https://bsky.app/profile/jimpick.com), either on BlueSky or via email at <a href="mailto:jim@jimpick.com">jim@jimpick.com</a>.
