# Welcome to Hex.Camp

The Hex.Camp open source project is building software tools and web hosting infrastructure for individuals and groups to enrich their local communities.

The core idea is a unique system for geographically organizing web sites, where each site is one of trillions of hexagons arranged on the world map. Combined with traditional and cutting edge web tools, communities can build online places to communicate, collaborate and archive. A non-profit governance model means that each community can be independent and self-reliant.

## What is it?

* Hexagons!
  * allow everybody to share information by placing things on a map
  * uses Uber's [H3](https://h3geo.org/) system for subdividing the world into hexagons
  * any hexagon can contain a website or data
  * hexagons can be "owned" by individual users or communities of users
  * core services are familiar web building blocks:
    * DNS
    * SSL
    * HTTP
  * super cheap to run
  * communities can run their own subsets of the global network
