# Stract

[Stract](https://stract.com/) is an open source web search engine written in Rust.

* [GitHub: Hexcamp Fork of stract - jim_hacks branch](https://github.com/hexcamp/stract/tree/jim_hacks)

  Contains some tweaks to the parser so it can ingest WARC files from the Common Crawl project collected using [cdx_toolkit](https://github.com/cocrawler/cdx_toolkit/)
  
## Status

* can build a search index from [collected WARC files](https://6kgruqaeaaaa.vichex.ca/community-associations/)
* only working on Jim's laptop ... next step is to deploy to vichex.ca
* upstream S3 bucket containing starter files is missing, replaced with publicly available files (I will upload my files somewhere)
