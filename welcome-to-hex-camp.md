# Welcome to Hex.Camp

Part of the "Local Wide Web" ... a place for websites that are built for your local community. 


**!!Under construction!!**

## What is it?

* a collection of ideas
* core idea: Hexagons!
  * allow everybody to share information by placing things on a map
  * uses Uber's [H3](https://www.uber.com/en-CA/blog/h3/) system for subdividing the world into hexagons
  * any hexagon can contain a website or data
  * hexagons can be "owned" by individual users or communities of users
  * global hierarchy of communities
* swarms!!
  * peer-to-peer collaborative hosting using WebRTC swarms
  * no servers! hardly anything runs in the cloud. very cheap
  * users can contribute hosting resources by running software on their machines at home
  * web sites and data are syncable between neighbouring users  in the swarm using technology from the [IPFS project](https://ipfs.tech/)
* community-driven reputation and moderation system
  * geographically localized user accounts using [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) federation
  * collaborative funding of infrastructure (most users pay nothing)
* web-based "[community modules](https://hackmd.io/omnX7l8aSPmyqEJbh5SPag)" provide interactivity
  * open source
  * users have choice 
  * run in a privacy "sandbox"
    * can only communicate with neighbours in the "swarm"
    * cannot communicate outside the sandbox (no advertising trackers)
* "fungible" infrastructure
  * people participating in a community can provide needed infrastructure, eg. IPFS pinning, by running software on their computers at home without having to invest a lot of time doing system administration tasks 

## Potential uses

* geographically local information
  * mapping 
  * archiving websites
  * curating
  * search engines
  * local business
  * community organizations
    * artists
    * gardening
    * charities 
  * government / municipalities

## Things to look at

* Maps
  * [Photos around the world](https://2kgrv5ga2i.hex.camp/)
  * [Demos](https://wkgrvqgfl4.hex.camp/)

## Tools

* [Encoded Hexagon ID Lookup Tool](https://6l22glmvqj2a.hex.camp/) - use this tool to figure out where an "encoded hexagon ID" is on the map (eg. )
