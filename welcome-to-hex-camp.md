# Welcome to Hex.Camp

Part of the "Local Wide Web" ... a place for websites that are built for your local community. 

## What is it?

* Hexagons!
  * allow everybody to share information by placing things on a map
  * uses Uber's [H3](https://h3geo.org/) system for subdividing the world into hexagons
  * any hexagon can contain a website or data
  * hexagons can be "owned" by individual users or communities of users
  * core services are familiar web building blocks:
    * DNS
    * SSL
    * HTTP
  * super cheap to run
  * communities can run their own subsets of the global network
